								In recent years, the number of people seeking ways reduce stress, increase
								mindfulness, and temporarily escape reality has proven to be substantial. There
								continues to be a strong demand for adult coloring books, guided meditation apps, and
								streaming services that play soothing sounds over calming images. The goal of Kinetic
								Radiance is to offer an easily accessible escape from reality that immerses the user
								in a world of sound and color.
							</p>
							<p>
								Kinetic Radiance began as a school assignment from my senior year at CSUN but has
								evolved into a pet project	of mine
								which I continue to work on.

							<h1 style="text-align: center;">About</h1>
							<p>
								This project was inspired by my fascination with kinetic sculptures and interactive art
								installations. A piece of art that changes with time or responds to the presence of
								onlookers captures my imagination in a way that traditional art does not. With this
								project, I want to create an environment in which one can use a virtual reality rig to
								surround themselves with highly customizable pieces of kinetic art. As an amateur
								musician, I chose music as the stimulus for my artwork to react to. I hope that users
								find Kinetic Radiance either a fun way to escape reality for a short time or a way
								to more fully immerse themselves in their favorite music.
							</p>
							<p>
								The first choice a user has to make when starting the application is what type of
								environment they would like to be in. They can choose the grandeur of a large hall,
								the comfort of a basement lounge, or and empty space with nothing to distract from
								the art.

								With the environment chosen, the user then needs to decide what type of artwork they
								want to populate their space with. They do this by interacting with the several
								"selector nodes" that are placed around the room. By pointing at the node with their
								controller and pulling the trigger, they open a menu from which they can select which
								piece of kinetic artwork they want to instantiate at that location. The user can move
								around the room using the thumb  sticks on their controllers and activate as many or
								as few nodes as they wish.

							<h1 style="text-align: center;">Skills</h1>
							<p>
								When I began this project I was only familiar with the basics of developing with
								Unity, so there were quite a few things I needed to learn in order to make it a
								success.
							</p>
							<p>
								On the music side of things, my first task was to learn how to implement a music player
								and create a playlist. This was relatively simple, but it was the first time I had
								dealt with song files in Unity and was a learning experience nonetheless. Figuring out
								how to
								parse the mp3 files to get frequency band data was where things got interesting. I
								learned about fast Fourier transforms and how they are used to deconstruct sound files
								into their composite frequencies. I then had to research the concept of "windowing"
								and do some experimentation to find which FFT window provided the best results for my
								dancing artwork. For those curious, the Blackman-Harris window is what I ended up
								choosing for this project.
							</p>
							<p>
								When it came to the visual aspect, I wanted the colors to be stunning and that meant
								I needed to learn how to use Unity's Universal Render Pipeline and the features
								it offers. My favorite parts of developing this project have been playing around with
								emissive materials, experimenting with global volume post-production effects, and
								seeing what	the	URP
								is capable of. Manipulating these values at compile time ended up being relatively
								straight-forward, but figuring out how to change a material's emissivity during
								runtime was trickier than I expected. I can hardly imagine working on a future project
								without	the URP, and I even went so far as to create my own project template with it
								enabled by default.
							</p>
							<p>
								The steepest learning curve by far came from developing the project for virtual
								reality. The class in which this project was assigned only taught concepts for Unity
								in 2D and 3D environments, so the VR development aspect was something I had to learn
								on my own. While Unity has a thriving developer community and there is a plenty of
								documentation online, the standards are changing so fast that I regularly found
								myself following tutorials that were already out of date despite being only a few
								months old. I also began writing scripts specifically for my Oculus (Meta) Quest 2
								before deciding that Khronos's Open XR standard was the better way to go. The process
								involved a lot of trial and error and many frustrating nights, but in the end I
								learned everything I needed to allow a user to move around and interact with a
								virtual environment.

				<!--To Do-->
					<section class="spotlight style1 orient-center content-align-left" id="todo">
						<div class="content">
							<h1 style="text-align: center;">Future Work</h1>
							<h2>In Progress</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>Always thinking up new designs for the kinetic art pieces</li>
								<li>Looking for more environment prefabs to offer the user more options</li>
								<li>Adding more interactive menus to allow the user to individually adjust the
									color intensity and kinetic response of each game object</li>
							</ul>
							<h2>What's Next?</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>Add multiplayer functionality so users can share the experience with others</li>
								<li>Add support for microphone input making it possible for Kinetic Radiance to
									work with ambient sounds instead of strictly through locally saved music files</li>
								<li>Create interactive effects based on the user's proximity to the artwork, e.g.,
									the color intensity could increase the closer the user is or the color palette
									could change dynamically as the user walks by</li>
							</ul>
							<h2>Someday...</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>Allow users to access their streaming services from inside the application</li>
								<li>Implement an augmented reality version </li>
							</ul>
